IMPROVEMENT ANALYSIS (Fog - NoFog)
================================================================================

This section tests directional hypotheses that Fog > NoFog for:
  • Average head angular speed (more head movement)
  • Cumulative head rotation (more total rotation)
  • Cumulative vertical/horizontal rotation (more structured scanning)
  • Viewing sphere coverage (better exploration)

One-tailed tests are used to test if improvements are significantly > 0.

INTERPRETATION SUMMARY
================================================================================

Out of 14 metrics analyzed, 6 showed statistically significant differences between Fog and NoFog conditions.

Key Findings:
  • Viewing Sphere Coverage (with FOV): increased in Fog condition (p=0.0043, d=0.963)
  • Cumulative Horizontal Rotation (Yaw): increased in Fog condition (p=0.0252, d=0.662)
  • Viewing Sphere Coverage: increased in Fog condition (p=0.0295, d=0.635)
  • Average Head Angular Speed: increased in Fog condition (p=0.0361, d=0.600)
  • Cumulative Head Rotation: increased in Fog condition (p=0.0398, d=0.582)

Effect Size Guidelines (Cohen's d):
  |d| < 0.2:  Negligible effect
  0.2 ≤ |d| < 0.5:  Small effect
  0.5 ≤ |d| < 0.8:  Medium effect
  |d| ≥ 0.8:  Large effect

METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

PAIRED DESIGN ANALYSIS:
  • Each participant completed both Fog and NoFog conditions
  • Paired statistical tests account for within-subject variability
  • More powerful than independent samples tests for this design

Statistical tests were chosen based on data distribution:
  • Paired design: Shapiro-Wilk test on differences
  • Normal differences: Paired t-test
  • Non-normal differences: Wilcoxon signed-rank test
  • One-tailed tests (fog > nofog) for metrics with directional hypotheses:
    - Average head angular speed
    - Cumulative head rotation
    - Cumulative vertical/horizontal rotation
    - Viewing sphere coverage
  • Effect sizes calculated using Cohen's d
  • Significance threshold: α = 0.05
  • Improvement analysis uses one-tailed tests to test if improvements > 0
