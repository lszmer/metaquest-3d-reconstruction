IMPROVEMENT ANALYSIS (Fog - NoFog)
================================================================================

This section tests directional hypotheses that Fog > NoFog for:
  • Average head angular speed (more head movement)
  • Cumulative head rotation (more total rotation)
  • Cumulative vertical/horizontal rotation (more structured scanning)
  • Viewing sphere coverage (better exploration)

One-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank tests are used to test if improvements are significantly > 0.

INTERPRETATION SUMMARY
================================================================================

Out of 14 metrics analyzed, 1 showed statistically significant differences between Fog and NoFog conditions.

Key Findings:
  • Viewing Sphere Coverage (with FOV): increased in Fog condition (p=0.0287, r=5.615)

Effect Size Guidelines (r - correlation coefficient):
  |r| < 0.1:  Negligible effect
  0.1 ≤ |r| < 0.3:  Small effect
  0.3 ≤ |r| < 0.5:  Medium effect
  |r| ≥ 0.5:  Large effect

================================================================================
METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

PAIRED DESIGN ANALYSIS:
  • Each participant completed both Fog and NoFog conditions
  • Wilcoxon signed-rank tests account for within-subject variability
  • More powerful than independent samples tests for this design

Median-based non-parametric statistical analysis:
  • All tests are non-parametric (distribution-free)
  • Paired design: Wilcoxon signed-rank test
  • Independent samples: Mann-Whitney U test
  • One-tailed tests (fog > nofog) for metrics with directional hypotheses:
    - Average head angular speed
    - Cumulative head rotation
    - Cumulative vertical/horizontal rotation
    - Viewing sphere coverage
  • Effect sizes calculated using correlation coefficient r = Z/√N
  • Significance threshold: α = 0.05
  • Descriptive statistics use median and MAD (Median Absolute Deviation)
